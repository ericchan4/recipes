        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Chinese tomato egg stir-fry is something you’ll find on many Chinese home dinner tables. 
            It’s fast, easy, cheap, and made with very simple, everyday ingredients.
            You’ll really be surprised at how tasty it is. 
            The tangy tomatoes, mixed with rich scrambled eggs, a hint of sugar, and flavorful sesame 
            oil and Shaoxing wine all come together to create a very satisfying (and 
            vegetarian!) dish that tastes lovely on a bed of rice.
            It also happens to be one of my go-to’s when I don’t know what else to 
            eat on a weeknight!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 small to medium tomatoes <em>(about 500 g, 1 pound)</em></li>
            <li>1 scallion</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt <em>(or to taste)</em></li>
            <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1/4-1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion.</li>
            <li>
                Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp white pepper,
                1/2 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tsp shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke.
                Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs. 
                Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions. 
                Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, 
                and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). 
                Add the cooked eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 
                1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.
            </li>
            <li>Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
