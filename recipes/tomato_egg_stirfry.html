        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Chinese tomato egg stir-fry is something you’ll find on many Chinese home dinner tables. 
            It’s fast, easy, cheap, and made with very simple, everyday ingredients.
            You’ll really be surprised at how tasty it is. 
            The tangy tomatoes, mixed with rich scrambled eggs, a hint of sugar, and flavorful sesame 
            oil and Shaoxing wine all come together to create a very satisfying (and 
            vegetarian!) dish that tastes lovely on a bed of rice.
            It also happens to be one of my go-to’s when I don’t know what else to 
            eat on a weeknight!
